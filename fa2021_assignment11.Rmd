***How to do it?***: 

- Open the Rmarkdown file of this assignment ([link](fa2021_assignment11.Rmd)) in Rstudio. 

- Right under each **question**, insert  a code chunk (you can use the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + I` to add a code chunk) and code the solution for the question. 

- `Knit` the rmarkdown file (hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + K`) to export an html.  

-  Publish the html file to your Githiub Page. 

***Submission***: Submit the link on Github of the assignment to Blackboard.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

-------

1. Install the package `mlbench` and use the follows to import the data

```{r}
library(mlbench)
data(PimaIndiansDiabetes)
df <- PimaIndiansDiabetes
```

- Set seed to be 2020. 
- The target variable is `diabetes`
- Partition the data into 80% training and 20% testing.  
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rpart)
library(caret)
view(df)
names(df)

#set the target variable as diabetes
names(df)[9] <- 'diabetes'

#remove missing values
df = drop_na(df)

#split the data to train and test 
set.seed(2020)
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df$diabetes, p = .80, list = FALSE)
df_train <- df[splitIndex,]
df_test <- df[-splitIndex,]
```

-------

2. Tuning Decision Tree:  Use cross-validation with 10 k-folds to find the maxdepth with the greatest accuracy. Plot the accuracy associated with different maxdepths against the maxdepths. The range to search for maxdepth is from 1 to 10. 
```{r}
#Decide the range of maxdepth to search for the best accuracy
tuneGrid = expand.grid(maxdepth = 1:10)

#Use caret to perform cross validation
trControl = trainControl(method = 'cv', number = 10)

tree_approach <- train(diabetes~., data=df_train, method = "rpart2", trControl = trControl, tuneGrid = tuneGrid)
```

-------

3. Make the final decision to select the maxdepth for your decision tree.  Is your selected maxdepth the same as the maxdepth found in 2? 
```{r}
plot(tree_approach)
```
A maxdepth of 2 would render the best results and highest accuracy for the decision tree. 
-------

4. Calculate the accuracy of your decision tree (the decision tree with your selected maxdepth in 3) on the test data. 
```{r}
pred <- predict(tree_approach, df_test)

cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$diabetes, positive = "pos")

cm$overall[1]
```
