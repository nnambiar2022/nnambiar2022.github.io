## Instruction

The midterm has two components: the Rmarkdown notebook (html) and the presentation.  We will do the presentation in class. Post both the notebook and the presentation on your Github page. 

**The notebook:** The notebook should be created using `rmarkdown` (like other assignments). The notebook should have a title. It should have a table of content (TOC form) or in a tab form. Here are the samples Rmarkdown for [TOC form](fa2021_midterm_toc.Rmd) and [tab form](fa2021_midterm_tab.Rmd)


**The Presentation:** Present your results in 5-10 minutes. To make the presentation using Rmarkdown, do the follows: 

    - In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> R markdown
    
    - In the left panel, click to Presentation -> Click OK
    
    - Now you have an Rmarkdown that can be knitted to be a html presentation 

- You can also use borrow a template of our class slides presentations. For example, [this slide](https://bryantstats.github.io/math421/slides/6_viz_fa21_2.html) has this [Rmarkdown](https://bryantstats.github.io/math421/slides/6_viz_fa21_2.Rmd)    

- You do not need to rerun all the codes for the presentation. For example, to show the model comparison, you just need to show the image of the model comparison instead of running all the models again.
    
- To inset an image in a slide, use  `![](image.png)`

- To turn off message and warning of a code cell, use:  `{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}` for the cell. 

**What to present**:

  - Present Part 2 - Visualization
  
  - Present Question Question 4, 5 and 6 in Part 3.  
  
  - Present any errors/challenges you run into and how you fix/overcome them. 

**Data:**  

The data for the mid-term project is the Rhode Island Department of Health Hospital Discharge Data.  Each row of the data presents a patient.

-------

## I. Data Wranggling

1. Download the data file `hdd0318cy.sas7bdat`.  

2. Use `read_sas` in library `haven` to read the data. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(haven)

df <- read_sas("C:/Users/student/Documents/Fall 2021/MATH 421/Math421/hdd0318cy.sas7bdat")
```

3. Filter the data to have only patients of the year 2018 (`yod==18`)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

df1 <- df %>% filter(yod=='18')
```

4. Select to work with only following variables: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
                      "yod", "payfix","pay_ub92","age",  
                      "sex","raceethn","provider","moa", 
                      "yoa","mod","admtype", "asource" , 
                      "preopday" ,"los", "service" , "icu","ccu",    
                      "dispub92", "payer"  ,"drg","trandb", 
                      "randbg","randbs","orr", "anes","seq",   
                      "lab","dtest", "ther","blood","phar", 
                      "other","patcon","bwght","total","tot" ,  
                      "ecodub92","b_wt","pt_state","diag_adm","ancilar" ,
                      "campus","er_fee","er_chrg","er_mode","obs_chrg",
                      "obs_hour","psycchrg","nicu_day"
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}

df1 <- select(df1, yod, payfix, pay_ub92, age, sex, raceethn, provider, moa, yoa, mod, admtype, asource, preopday, los, service, icu, ccu, dispub92, payer, drg, trandb, randbg, randbs, orr, anes, seq, lab, dtest, ther, blood, phar, other, patcon, bwght, total, tot, ecodub92, b_wt, pt_state, diag_adm, ancilar, campus, er_fee, er_chrg, er_mode, obs_chrg, obs_hour, psycchrg, nicu_day)

head(df1)
```


*Notice*:  You may want to save the current data to your computer for easy access later.  To save the data file use `write_csv(df, 'midterm.csv')`, for example.  
```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

df1 <- read_csv('midterm.csv')
```

5. What are variables that have missing values?
```{r}
colSums(is.na(df1 ))
```
The variables that have missing values are payfix, raceethn, preopday, bwght, ecodub92, pt_state, diag_adm, er_mode, obs_hour, and nicu_day.

6. Remove all variables with missing values
```{r}
df1 <- select(df1, -payfix, -preopday, -bwght, -ecodub92, -pt_state, -diag_adm, -er_mode, -obs_hour, -nicu_day)

colSums(is.na(df1))
```

7. Refer to the data description in the file `HDD2015-18cy6-20-19.docx`, which variable recording the month of admission?, which variable recording the month of discharge?

MOA = Month of Admission
MOD = Month of Discharge

8. Which month admitted the most number of patients? Which month admitted the most number of male patients?
```{r}
df1 %>% count(moa, sort = TRUE)
```
October

```{r}
df1 %>% filter(sex==1) %>% count(moa, sort = TRUE)
```
October

9. Which month has the most number of teenage female patients?
```{r}
df1 %>% filter(sex==2, age < 20, age >= 13) %>% count(moa, sort = TRUE)
```
March

10. Which provider has the most number of female patients in October? 
```{r}
df1 %>% filter(sex==2, moa==10) %>% count(provider, sort = TRUE)
```
Rhode Island Hospital

11. Is female patients older than male patients, on average? 
```{r}
df1 %>% filter(sex != 9) %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(avg_age = mean(age))
```
Female patients tend to be a bit younger than male patients.

12. Calculate the average age of patients by months. Which month has the oldest patients on average age?
```{r}
df1 %>% filter(sex != 9) %>% group_by(moa) %>% summarise(avg_age = mean(age)) %>% arrange(desc(avg_age))
```
January

13. What is the name of the provider that has the highest total charge?
```{r}
df1 %>% group_by(provider) %>% summarise(total_charge = sum(tot)) %>% arrange(desc(total_charge))
```
Rhode Island Hospital

14. What is the name of the provider that has the least total charge for teenage male on average?
```{r}
df1 %>% filter(sex==1, age < 20, age >= 13) %>% group_by(provider) %>% summarise(tot_charge = mean(tot)) %>% arrange(tot_charge)
```
Roger Williams

15. Create a season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) variable. Calculate the length of stays by season. Which season has the longest length of stays on average?
```{r}
df1 %>% mutate(season = ifelse(moa %in% c(1, 2, 12), "Winter", ifelse(moa %in% c(3, 4, 5), "Spring", ifelse(moa %in% c(6, 7, 8), "Summer", ifelse(moa %in% c(9, 10, 11), "Fall", NA))))) %>% group_by(season) %>% summarize(avg_los = mean(los)) %>% arrange(desc(avg_los))
```
Both Summer and Fall have the same los value, but Summer comes first.

16. On average, how much does a 20 year-old male get charged for staying 1 day in D?
```{r}
df1 %>% filter(sex==1, age==20, raceethn==1, los==1) %>% summarise(avg_price = mean(tot, na.rm = TRUE))
```

17. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

In this section, I was able to get an idea of the type of data that I am working with. According to the data, October is the month that has the greatest number of admitted patients. March had the most number of teenage female patients. Rhode Island Hospital seems to be a popular provider for female patients. Among the patients admitted, female patients tend to be a bit younger than male patients. Since Rhode Island Hospital is popular, it is no surprise that it has the highest total charge. On the other hand, Roger Williams has the least total charge for teenage males on average. Both Summer and Fall have a high length of stay amount.

## II. Data Visualization

Continue with the data from part I. 

1. Provides at least 10 meaningful plots. Comments on the plots. All plots should have title, caption, appropriate labels on x and y-axis
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
```

2. Make an animation plot. 
```{r}

library(gganimate)
library(lubridate)

g11 <- df1 %>% filter(raceethn==1|raceethn==2|raceethn==3) %>% group_by(moa, raceethn) %>% summarise(mean = mean(tot)) %>% mutate(rank=rank(-mean))
p11 <- g11 %>% ggplot(aes(y=factor(rank), x=mean, group=raceethn, fill = raceethn)) + geom_col() + transition_states(moa) + labs(x = 'total patient charges', title = 'Month: {closest_state}', caption = 'Rank 1: White; Rank 2: Black; Rank 3: Asian')

animate(p11, n=250, fps=20)
```

3. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

In this section, I created 10 exploratory plots just to visualize some of the data. Some of the variables that I focused on were age, sex, race, provider, and payer. It was interesting to see that Rhode Island Hospital was the most popular hospital for patients. Blue Cross is more popular for babies in terms of health insurance, while Medicare was more popular for the elderly. One variable I would have liked to look into is service, but it did not have enough significant data to perform any analysis. 

-------

## III. Predictive Models

Continue with the data from part I. Use the follows as the target and input variables: 

*Target Variable*: Create the target variable taking value of 

  - `low` if the total charge of a patient (`tot`) is smaller than the median of the total charge, and

  - `high` otherwise. 
```{r}
median(df1$tot)

df1$target <- ifelse(df1$tot < median(df1$tot), "low", "high")

head(df1)
```

*Input Variables*:

  - "age","sex","raceethn","provider","moa","mod","admtype","campus", 'los'
```{r}
model_df <- df1 %>% select("target", "age", "sex","provider", "moa","mod","raceethn", "admtype", "campus", "los" )
names(df1)[1] <- 'target'

names(model_df)

model_df <- drop_na(model_df, age, sex, raceethn, moa, mod, campus, los, target)
```

-------

1. Use `filter` function to filter out rows where `raceethn==''` or `admtype==''`. Make sure all the categorical variables are factor, numeric variables are numeric. Set Training : Testing Split = 10 : 90 
```{r}
model_df <- model_df %>% filter(admtype==1|admtype==2)
model_df$sex = factor(model_df$sex)
model_df$raceethn = factor(model_df$raceethn)
model_df$provider = factor(model_df$provider)
model_df$campus = factor(model_df$campus)
model_df$admtype=factor(model_df$admtype)
model_df$target=factor(model_df$target)
```
```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(2020)
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(model_df$target, p=.05, list=FALSE)
model_df_train <- model_df[splitIndex,]
model_df_test <- model_df[-splitIndex,]
```

2. Train a decision tree using `rpart`.  Plot the decision tree. Plot the variable importance ranked by the tree. 
```{r}
library(rpart) 

dec_tree <- rpart(target ~ ., data = model_df_train,
                 control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 5))

dec_tree$variable.importance
```
```{r}
barplot(dec_tree$variable.importance)
```

3. Using caret for this question. Set `Training Control` to be: Use Cross-Validation of 5 folds across all models.  Train & tune at least 3 different models (i.e. three different values for `method=` in the train function of caret).  Plot the hyper-parameter tuning plots for each model. 
```{r}
#Decision Tree Model

tuneGrid = expand.grid(maxdepth = 2:10)
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)
tree_approach <- train(target~., data=model_df_train, 
                                method = "rpart2", 
                                trControl = trControl,
                                tuneGrid = tuneGrid)
plot(tree_approach)
```
```{r}
# Random Forest Model 

tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 3:5)
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)
rf_model <- train(target~., data=model_df_train, 
                                method = "rf", 
                                trControl = trControl,
                                tuneGrid = tuneGrid)

plot(rf_model)
```
```{r}
#KNN Model

trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)

knn <- train(target~., data=model_df_train, 
                    method = "kknn", 
                    trControl = trControl)
plot(knn)
```

4. Plot the comparison of the models in 3. 
```{r}
results <- resamples(list('Decision Tree' = tree_approach,
                          'Random Forest' = rf_model,
                          'K-Nearest Neighbors'= knn))
bwplot(results)
```

5. What is your final selection for the model? Test the accuracy of your final model on the test data. 
```{r}
#The best model seems to be the random forest model in comparison to the decision tree and knn model.

pred <- predict(rf_model, model_df_test)
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = model_df_test$target, positive = "high")
cm$overall[1] #not a great score but it's good: 0.8217435
```

6. Create another `target` variable (binary), decide the input variables and redo 1 to 5. 
```{r}
median(df1$los)

df1$target <- case_when(df1$los<3 ~ "low", df1$los>=3 ~ "high")

head(df1)

model_df1 <- df1 %>% select("target", "age", "sex","provider", "moa","mod","raceethn", "admtype", "campus", "tot" )
names(model_df1)[1] <- 'target'

names(model_df1)

model_df1 <- drop_na(model_df1, age, sex, raceethn, moa, mod, campus, tot, target)
```

```{r}
model_df1$sex = factor(model_df1$sex)
model_df1$raceethn = factor(model_df1$raceethn)
model_df1$provider = factor(model_df1$provider)
model_df1$campus = factor(model_df1$campus)
model_df1$admtype=factor(model_df1$admtype)
model_df1$target=factor(model_df1$target)

library(caret)
set.seed(2020)
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(model_df1$target, p = .05, list = FALSE)

model_df1_train <- model_df1[splitIndex,]
model_df1_test <- model_df1[-splitIndex,]
```
```{r}
library(rpart) 

dec_tree1 <- rpart(target ~ ., data = model_df1_train,
                 control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 5))

dec_tree1$variable.importance

barplot(dec_tree1$variable.importance)
```
```{r}
#Decision Tree Model

tuneGrid = expand.grid(maxdepth = 3:4)
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 2)
tree_approach1 <- train(target~., data=model_df1_train, 
                                method = "rpart2", 
                                trControl = trControl,
                                tuneGrid = tuneGrid)
plot(tree_approach1)
```
```{r}

                                method = "rf", 
                                trControl = trControl,
                                tuneGrid = tuneGrid)

plot(rf_model1)
```


```{r}

trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 2)

knn1 <- train(target~., data=model_df1_train, 
                    method = "kknn", 
                    trControl = trControl)
plot(knn1)
```


```{r}
results <- resamples(list('Decision Tree' = tree_approach1,
                          'Random Forest' = rf_model1,
                          'K-Nearest Neighbors'= knn1))
bwplot(results)
```


```{r}
#The best model seems to be the random forest model in comparison to the decision tree and knn model.

model_df1_test <- model_df1_test %>% drop_na(admtype)


pred <- predict(rf_model1, model_df1_test)
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = model_df1_test$target, positive = "high")
cm$overall[1] #0.8217213
```

7. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

I was a bit disappointed that the accuracy scores I got for my models were not as high. When I tested them out twice with Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN, I found that my random forest model worked the best. However, both accuracy scores stayed in the 82% range. Next time I could try and see if it would make any difference for the accuracy scores if I were to try other various types of models and work a bit more with the specifications of each model.
