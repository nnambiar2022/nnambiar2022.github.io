## Prediciting Total Patient Charge

- Target Variable: Total Patient Charge (tot)

-`low` if the total charge of a patient (`tot`) is smaller than the median of the total charge, and

- `high` otherwise.

## Predicting Length of Stay

- I created a binary variable from the los column. I used 3 since that is the median los value.
- los < 3, "low"
- los >= 3, "high"

## Challenges

- Run time for models
- Some variables were not clear or did not have enough information/values
-adding in images was a challenge
- Kniting and pushing files to Github
